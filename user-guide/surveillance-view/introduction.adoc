When networks are larger and contain devices of different priority, it becomes interesting to show at a glance how the "whole system" is working.
The surveillance view aims to do that. By using categories, you can define a matrix which allows to aggregate monitoring results.
Imagine you have 10 servers with 10 internet connections and some 5 PCs with DSL lines:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
|                    | Servers | Internet Connections
| Super important    | 1 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Slightly important | 0 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Vanity             | 4 of 10 | 0 of 10
|===

The whole idea is to give somebody at a glance a hint on where the trouble is.
The matrix-type of display allows a significantly higher aggregation than the simple list.
In addition, the surveillance view shows nodes rather than services - an important tidbit of information when you look at categories.
At a glance, you want to know how many of my servers have an issue rather than how many services in this category have an issue.

The visual indication for outages in the surveillance view cells is defined as the following:

* No services down: green as normal
* One (1) service down: yellow as warning
* More than one (1) services down: red as critical

This _Surveillance View_ model also builds the foundation of the <<user-guide-dashboard, Dashboard View>>.
